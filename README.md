- 👋 Hi, I’m @float437
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about programming and game development! I'm a freshman at FIU studying Computer Science and want to learn as much as I can about the field!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning learning Java and have joined the Spark Dev team at FIU to learn the game development process.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me to think outside the box and that can give me experience in the programming world.
